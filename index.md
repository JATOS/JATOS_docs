JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) helps you setup and run your online studies on your own server.

JATOS 2 allows you to [run group studies](Example-Group-Studies), where multiple workers can interact with each other.
 
You can read our [open access paper](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0130834) for the basics, but this wiki contains up-to-date information about the new group feature.

We also started a [blog about JATOS and online experiments in general](http://blog.jatos.org). There we'll post about topics that do not necessarily fit into this wiki.
