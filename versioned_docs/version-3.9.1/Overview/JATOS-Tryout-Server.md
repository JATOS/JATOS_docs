### JATOS Tryout Server: Cortex

Cortex is a live JATOS server available for you to experience JATOS online, offering an alternative to a local installation.

Access it at: [https://cortex.jatos.org](https://cortex.jatos.org)

You can log in using the credentials `test@jatos.org` and `abc1234`, or via a Google or ORCID account. This is a standard JATOS installation with many example studies already imported (visible only with the test account). Feel free to run these examples or import your own studies to test them in an online JATOS environment.

**Important Considerations for Cortex:**

* **Daily Reset:** This JATOS server is **reset daily** to its initial state. All changes you make, experiments you upload, and data you collect will be **lost**.
* **Public Access:** There is only one shared login account (unless you use a Google/ORCID account), meaning other users can view, delete, or access your data.

**Therefore, it is crucial that you DO NOT use this JATOS instance to run actual studies or collect real data. Cortex is solely intended as a demonstration and testing environment.**
