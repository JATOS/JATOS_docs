JATOS primarily handles the server-side aspects of your study, such as storing result data and managing workers. It doesn't dictate what happens within the browser itselfâ€”that's where your HTML, JavaScript, and CSS come in. While you can write all of this yourself, using a framework can be very helpful; [jsPsych](http://www.jspsych.org/) is an excellent option.

You'll find several jsPsych examples among [our example studies](/Example-Studies).

Below are the necessary modifications to adapt your jsPsych experiment to run within JATOS and send data to it. For more general guidance, you can also refer to [Adapt Pre-written Code to run it in JATOS](Adapt-pre-written-code-to-run-it-in-JATOS.html).

Please note that sometimes jsPsych versions have slight differences. These steps are for **jsPsych 7 or 8** (for older versions, please see [here](/3.6.x/jsPsych-and-JATOS.html)).

### How to Turn Your jsPsych 7 or 8 Experiment into a JATOS Study

1.  **Include the _jatos.js_ library** in the `<head>` section of your HTML file:

    ```html
    <script src="jatos.js"></script>
    ```

2.  **Configure jsPsych to send results to JATOS.** If you wish to include an automatic "Cancel" button using `jatos.addAbortButton`, include that line as well (otherwise, omit it):

    ```javascript
    var jsPsych = initJsPsych({
      on_trial_start: jatos.addAbortButton,
      on_finish: () => jatos.startNextComponent(jsPsych.data.get().json())
    });
    ```

    The `jatos.startNextComponent` ends the current component in JATOS and either starts the next one (if you have multiple components) or finishes the study.

3.  **Wrap jsPsych's `run` command within `jatos.onLoad`**:

    ```javascript
    jatos.onLoad(() => {
      jsPsych.run(timeline);
    });
    ```

That's all there is to it! For a complete example using jsPsych, check out the '_Simple Reaction Time Task_' in our [example studies](Example-Studies). Additionally, the '_jsPsych 8 Examples_' study offers 79 different jsPsych demos and examples.
