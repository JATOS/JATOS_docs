OSWeb allows you to run an [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl) experiment directly in a browser. OpenSesame is a powerful tool for creating experiments in psychology, neuroscience, and experimental economics. You can achieve a great deal using its drag-and-drop interface, and you also have the option to add code snippets for more advanced flexibility.

[OSWeb's documentation](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/manual/osweb/workflow/) is comprehensive. Therefore, we'll simply highlight the straightforward process of combining OSWeb with JATOS: just export your experiment from OSWeb and import it into JATOS.

If you plan to use [Prolific](https://www.prolific.co/) to recruit participants for your OpenSesame experiment running in JATOS, you can paste the return link into the 'End Redirect URL' field of your Study Properties within the JATOS GUI.
