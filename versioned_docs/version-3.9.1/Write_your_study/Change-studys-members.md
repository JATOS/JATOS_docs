Each experimenter who can access the JATOS server through the GUI is a **JATOS User**. Users are authorized to create, modify, and delete studies they are members of, as well as export and delete results.

A study in JATOS can have multiple users, also referred to as **members**. Each member possesses the same permissions; for instance, they can run the study, create new Workers, add/change/delete components, and export/delete results. Notably, any member can add new members or remove existing ones.

You'll find a **Change users** button in each study's toolbar.

Within this menu, you can add individual users by their username. This is only possible if the user is already a registered JATOS user. For privacy reasons, JATOS does not display usernames (which are often email addresses) in the member list.

To remove a user, simply click the **Remove** button in that user's row.

Additionally, if allowed by your JATOS administrators, you may have the option to add all JATOS users to a study at once or remove all members. In such cases, you will see **Add All** and **Remove All** buttons.
