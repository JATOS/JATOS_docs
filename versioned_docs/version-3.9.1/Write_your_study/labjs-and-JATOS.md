[lab.js](https://lab.js.org/) is a user-friendly tool for creating online experiments. Its [builder](https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/) simplifies the experiment creation process, though lab.js also supports direct coding if you prefer.

lab.js and JATOS are a perfect fit because **lab.js can directly export JATOS studies**. This means you don't need to write or modify any code. Simply create your experiment using lab.js, then import your studies directly into JATOS and begin collecting data from participants.

lab.js already provides [excellent documentation](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), including a page specifically dedicated to JATOS: [Collecting data with JATOS](https://labjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/learn/deploy/3c-jatos.html).
