Usually you conveniently develop your study on your local computer where you have a [local installation of JATOS](Installation.html). Then just use the export and import buttons in your installations to transfer the study to your [JATOS server](Bring-your-JATOS-online.html).

If you have a server already, you will need to take your ready-to-run study from your local installation and deploy it to the server. In order to do this:

1. On your *local* JATOS installation, open your study and click on **Export** in the study toolbar. A pop-up window will appear. Save the [_.jzip_](JATOS-Study-Archive-JZIP.html) file wherever you like on your computer.
1. On your *server* JATOS, go to the study sidebar (click top-left on **Studies**), click "**+**", and then **Import study**. Select the _.jzip_ file you have exported earlier.


**Please note that:**

* The two JATOS look almost identical, and you will (basically) only distinguish them on the basis of the URL in the browser. To prevent confusion, we've made it easier: A local JATOS installation has a **gray** JATOS logo in the top bar - a server installation a **colored** logo. 
* A **_.jzip_** file is a [JATOS Study Archive](JATOS-Study-Archive-JZIP.html). It is using the ZIP archive file format. It contains everything to describe a study like study properties and study assets. Do not unzip it - Always import the *.jzip* to JATOS. 
* In the process of exporting/importing you'll transfer all assets of your study (HTML/JS/CSS files, images, audio, etc) contained in the local study folder. You will **not** transfer result data. 
* If you want to make changes to a study, we also recommend that you do so in the local JATOS. There you have full access to the study assets and can change and edit them easily. Then again you can Export â†’ Import to the JATOS server.
