Here is an example for a configuration of [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a reverse proxy in front of JATOS. It is not necessary to run JATOS with a proxy but it's common.

A JATOS server that handles sensitive or private data should always use encryption (HTTPS). A nice free certificate issuer is [certbot.eff.org](https://certbot.eff.org/) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The following config is the content of `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`. Change it to your needs. You probably want to change your servers address (`www.example.com` in the example) and the path to the SSL certificate and its key.

For JATOS versions 3.8.1 and older it is necessary to set the `X-Forwarded-*` headers with `proxy_set_header` to tell JATOS the original requester's IP address. This is not necessary from 3.8.2 and newer.

As an additional security measurement you can uncomment the `location /jatos` and config your local network. This will restrict the access to JATOS' GUI (every URL starting with `/jatos`) to the local network.
