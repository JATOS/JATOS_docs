JATOS (Just Another Tool for Online Studies) helps you set up and run your online studies on your own server.

**New: [MindProbe](https://mindprobe.eu/), a free server for hosting online experiments. Powered by JATOS. Sponsored by the [European Society for Cognitive Psychology (ESCoP)](https://www.escop.eu/) with [Journal of Cognition](https://www.journalofcognition.org/) as their official journal and [OpenSesame](https://osdoc.cogsci.nl/).**

**Please complete our short [survey](https://forms.gle/Jtjw4LxpyWVFEtG17) on how (much) you use JATOS (ca. 3 min). It’s very important for us!**
